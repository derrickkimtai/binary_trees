# C - Binary trees
<h2>Binary Tree</h2>
<p>A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.</p>
<h2>Binary Search Tree</h2>
<p>Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
		<li>The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.</li>
		<li>The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.</li>
		<li>The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.</li>
